I am Ling Pei, [a professor and doctoral supervisor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University]((https://ssse.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/308)). Additionally, I serve as [the Director of the E-Valley Innovation Center at Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://ev.sjtu.edu.cn/) and [the Executive Vice Dean of the Shanghai Beidou Navigation Innovation Institute](http://www.bdi.org.cn/). My research focuses on indoor-outdoor seamless positioning and multimodal fusion positioning and navigation technologies. I have published over 60 SCI papers and a total of more than 100 academic papers and books. My Google Scholar citation count exceeds 4000, with an H-index of 33, a 10-index of 79, and a 100-index of 9. In 2014, I was selected for the Shanghai Pujiang Talent Program. In 2022, I was featured in the "[Top 2% Global Scientists List]((https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/5))" released by Stanford University. In 2023, I led a team that won the first prize in Satellite Navigation and Positioning Technology Progress. To date, I have led over 20 projects including National Natural Science Foundation projects and pre-research common technology projects, with 25 authorized invention patents and 4 technology transfers. In 2018, I chaired the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's industry standard "General Index and Test Method for Low-Speed Unmanned System Positioning and Navigation." I received the Shanghai Science and Technology Progress Special Prize in 2016, the National Science and Technology Progress Second Prize in 2017, the Second Prize of China Electric Power Science and Technology Progress in 2019, and the First Prize of Satellite Navigation and Positioning Technology Progress in 2023. Currently, my main research directions include human posture estimation, positioning and mapping based on multisource sensor fusion, and roadless navigation, each led by three doctoral students: [Songpengcheng.Xia](https://songpengchengxia.netlify.app/), [Qi.Wu](https://sjtu-robotics.com/), and [Zhen.Sun]() I'm looking for master and doctoral students.
