I am Qi Wu(吴奇- in Chinese, Pronounce), a member of the Paopao SLAM robot team, currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, focusing on the research of SLAM algorithms that integrate various sensor technologies. I have a strong interest in combining new types of sensors (such as 360-degree cameras and millimeter-wave radar) and exploring implicit three-dimensional reconstruction algorithms like NeRF etc. My doctoral journey is under the guidance of [Wenxian Yu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenxian-Yu) and [Ling Pei](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=Vm7d2EkAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW&oi=sra). Previously, I obtained my master's degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, under the mentorship of [Jiao Jichao](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=2uaYjQ4AAAAJ) and [Deng Zhongliang](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=Dm2WVQwAAAAJ); and I completed my undergraduate degree at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, guided by Professor [Mu Zhou](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=uBUdQkgAAAAJ), who introduced me to localization researching area.

I hope to share the papers I've read and some project codes from the past five years through this blog, hoping to assist those who are deeply interested in SLAM research.
